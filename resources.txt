Do this for info about timers:
grep TIMER_TO_USE *.h | grep define

If I want to use the onboard temperature sensor, I will need a timer for the analog to 
digital conversion. 

TIM1, TIM2, TIM3, TIM4, TIM5, TIM8 are viable for quadrature reading.
The Olimex boards have pinouts for ports D,E,F,G.

Also (in the arduino headers) 
PA4
PA5
PA6
PB5
PC0 (Among the analog pins)

TIM1 E9 E11
TIM2 (no real options)   32-bit
TIM3 (no real options)
TIM4 D12 D13
TIM5 (no real options)   32-bit
TIM8 (no real options)

Black  = Ground
Green  = 5.0V
Yellow = Channel B
Red    = Channel A

Yellow Green  Red    Blank   Black
Black  Blank  Red    Green    Yellow

Yellow Green  Red    Black
Black  Red    Green  Yellow


avoid PD2 it is used for SD_MMC

gpio	C13	Onboard Green LED
gpio	A0	Onboard User Push Button.

Timer	TIM14	Microsecond Delay Timer
Timer	TIM13	32768Hz timebase (This is a self-tutorial, not needed in the final product)
Timer   TIM12   Used for keypad.
