In the nutation calculation 
double CAANutation::NutationInLongitude(double JD)
and
double CAANutation::NutationInObliquity(double JD)

the function

CAACoordinateTransformation::MapTo0To360Range(double)

is called several times with large argument. > 60000.
This results in considerable looping 360 is repeatedly subtracted.
